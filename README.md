## Getting started
### Info
To install dependencies and run zirc you can use either [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/). If you want to build zirc by your own I would [highly](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/issues/1147#issuecomment-276284477) recommend to use yarn only!
Due to issues using the latest version of [electron-builder](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder) I recommend to not upgrade the working version **19.54.0**!
